#SimpleAdventure Tutorial

We're going to make a REALLY simple game involving Kanye West. You can find all the code for this tutorial [in the sample directory](/sample).

##Before you start
Download the files from this Github repository. 

##Getting Started

The first thing we'll do is set up our game folder. Come up with a name for your app. This isn't the "TITLE"; this is just what the file is going to be called. Since this is a sample, we'll call ours `sample` (which isn't the best name, but it works).

We make a folder NEXT TO our `maker.js` file and call it the name we just came up with. For us that's `sample`. Inside that folder, make three folders `music`, `objects`, and `scenes`. These are where the images and music for our game will go. Finally, make a file called `make.json` and put it next to those folders. You should end up with a folder structure like this:
```
|--maker.js
|--sample
   |--music
   |--objects
   |--scenes
   |--make.json
```
